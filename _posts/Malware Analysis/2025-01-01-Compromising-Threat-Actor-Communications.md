Traditionally, the vast majority of malware would communicate to a threat actor owned server via a threat actor owned domain or IP address. This domain or IP would likely be hardcoded within the malware sample somewhere, such that when executed, it would reach out to establish Command and Control (C2). This technique for C2 still remains prevalent, but there has been an observed shift into threat actors using trusted services, like Slack, Discord, or Telegram. Using trusted services allows malware to “hide in plain sight.” Network defenders typically whitelist or don’t scrutinize traffic to well-known platforms. By shifting C2 communications to these channels, attackers can bypass many conventional security controls and delay detection.

The website [LOLC2](https://lolc2.github.io/) details a common list of legitimate services that can be abused by C2. There are some noteable entries in the list, including [CounterStrike 1.6](https://github.com/eversinc33/1.6-C2) or [Lichess](https://github.com/0x-Apollyon/Malnus-Carlware). These are more niche entries, developed for fun, but services like Telegram for C2 remains a prevalent threat.
