This is an easy rated Windows machine on [TJ Null's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) OSCP prep list. Due to OSCP restrictions on auto-pwn tools, we will be purposefully doing this challenge without Metasploit. 

Keep in mind, you can solve this with Metasploit within minutes!

# Reconnaissance

## Nmap 

`nmap -p- -T4 -sV -sC -v -o full_thorough.log granny.htb`

[![1](/assets/images/Granny/1.png)](/assets/images/Granny/1.png){: .full}

Nice, just one port open. This narrows down our possible exploitation methods giving us a handful of clear routes to initial access. It's also looking like a WebDAV server, let's enumerate this further!

## Web

Let's begin with some basic directory enumeration to see if there are any folders which we can investigate!

### ffuf

`ffuf -w /usr/.../Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u http://granny.htb/FUZZ -fc 404`

[![2](/assets/images/Granny/2.png)](/assets/images/Granny/2.png){: .full}

This doesn't discover anything interesting.

### davtest

As this is a WebDAV server, we should of course check if it's possible to upload a webshell. `davtest` is a tool that will do just this!

`davtest -url http://granny.htb`

[![3](/assets/images/Granny/3.png)](/assets/images/Granny/3.png){: .full}

It looks like we can upload mutiple file types succesfully, but can unfortunately only execute `.html` & `.txt`, meaning RCE via this would not work.

### IIS 6.0

You may have noticed from our nmap scan that IIS 6.0 is running, which is also very outdated. Let's research if their are any vulnerabilities, or publically accessible exploits, for this specific version.

After a quick Google, I discovered [this](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/17/c/iis-6-0-vulnerability-leads-code-execution.html) article. It's an article explaining [CVE-2017-7269](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7269), a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the ScStoragePathFromUrl function in WebDAV! 

# Initial Access

## POC

There are many POCs, including a Metasploit module for this exploit, online. The one I found which worked is [this](https://github.com/crypticdante/CVE-2017-7269). 

Let's clone this repo and attempt it!

[![4](/assets/images/Granny/4.png)](/assets/images/Granny/4.png){: .full}

Fantastic! We got a shell as `nt authority\network service`

# Privilege Escalation

## network service -> local system

Let's start of some basic enumeration of the box, and see if we can find any flags.

### Version discovery

The `systeminfo` command is good for enumeration the specific OS version, as well as all the hotfixes (patches), which are installed. 

[![8](/assets/images/Granny/8.png)](/assets/images/Granny/8.png){: .full}

Windows Server 2003 was EOL (extended) in 2015, and only has 1 hotfix installed, meaning there is likely to be LOTS of different routes for priv esc. I don't like kernel exploits, so let's try find a 'nice' route.

### User Enum

[![5](/assets/images/Granny/5.png)](/assets/images/Granny/5.png){: .full}

We can see two interesting users `Lakis` & `Administrator`, this is most likely the users who will have our lovely flags. Let's see if we can go to their home directorys.

[![6](/assets/images/Granny/6.png)](/assets/images/Granny/6.png){: .full}

We got `Access is denied` for both these accounts, which means the service user, `nt authority\network service`, doesn't have enough privileges. Let's see if we can privilege escalate to `nt authority\system`, this would basically give us full access and all the flags

### Token abuse

Let's enumerate the privileges our service account has with `whoami /priv`

[![7](/assets/images/Granny/7.png)](/assets/images/Granny/7.png){: .full}

The `SeImpersonatePrivilege` stood out to me. This privilege is commonly given to local service accounts to allow them to impersonate another client after authentication.

First of all, what is impersonation? Impersonation is the ability of a thread to execute using different security information than the process that owns the thread.

There are many publically accessible executables which will perform this PE for us, like `JuicyPotato`, `PrintSpoofer`, `RougePotato` ect... However, I don't believe these are compatible for Windows Server 2003, so I instead when for `churassco`. Source code & executable can be found [here](https://github.com/Re4son/Churrasco/).

### churrasco

To use churrasco to PE, I'd first need to get the executables `churassco.exe` & `nc.exe` onto the box. I found the directory `C:\wmpub`, which I had write privileges over. I set up a SMB server on my Kali machine with:

`smbserver.py share .`

and used the DOS command `copy` to transfer the files.

[![8](/assets/images/Granny/8.png)](/assets/images/Granny/8.png){: .full}

You can see from the above both executables are now on the box. Let's get another revshell listener on port `4443` and attempt to execute this.

[![9](/assets/images/Granny/9.png)](/assets/images/Granny/9.png){: .full}

Fantastic. We are now running as `nt authority\system`. We can retrieve the both `user.txt` & `root.txt` from `Lakis` & `Administrator`'s desktop respectively.

Hope you've enjoyed this writeup and I'll see you on the next one!
