From this scan we can add `fabricorp.local` and `fuse.fabricorp.local` to our hosts file.

### SMB

Let's try see if guest/null authentication is enabled.

![1](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231014172549.png)

It looks like credentials `:` don't give an error. Let's see if we can enumerate any information from this. 

![[/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231014172649.png]]

No luck!

### Web

The webserver on port 80 is hosting a PaperCut Print Logging service. From this page we can discover a list of usernames.

# Initial Access

### AS-REPRoasting

We can check if any of these users are AS-REPRoastable or have the AD attribute `Don't require Kerberos pre-authentication` set. This would allow us to recover a password hash and possibly crack it.

![6](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231014173153.png)

No luck. Instead we can try a password spray attack.

### Password Spray

First we need to generate a wordlist. You can create a custom wordlist with `hashcat` rules, or use a tool like `cewl` to crawl the webserver and scrape for possible passwords.

`cewl http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/index.htm -d 5 -m 5 -x 12 --with-numbers | tee pwds.txt`

Now with the wordlist generated we can attempt to password spray.

`crackmapexec smb fabricorp.local -u users.txt -p pwds.txt`

There was a lot of interesting results for password `Fabricorp01`. It looks like multiple users: `bhult`, `tlavel` and `bnielson` all have this password, but it's expired.

![7](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231014180419.png)

We can change passwords using the `impacket-smbpasswd` tool!

![8](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231014181036.png)

After changing the password we can login to RPCClient and use the `enumdomusers` command to dump all domain users.

![9](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231023130616.png)

We can see there are two printing related user accounts (`svc-print`, `svc-scan`). Let's use the `enumprinters` to see if there is any domain joined printers.

![10](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231023145417.png)

Interesting. In the description of the printer we can see credentials `$fab@s3Rv1ce$1`. Let's password spray with this now.

![11](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231023145524.png)

![12](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231023145540.png)

It looks like `$fab@s3Rv1ce$1` works as a password for both `svc-print` & `svc-scan` over SMB, and also `svc-print` can WinRM onto the box.

# Privilege Escalation

Investigating the permissions of the `svc-print` user reveals we have the ability to load drivers with the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. 

![13](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231024122149.png)

We can perhaps use a BYOVD technique. First, I'll use the [EoPLoadDriver](https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver) technqiue to load the `Capcom.sys` vulnerable driver.

![14](/assets/images/Fuse/Pasted image 20231024122134.png)

We can create a reverse-shell binary and use the CapcomExploit from [here](https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom) to escalate privileges to `nt authority\system`.
