This was an easy rated HTB Solaris machine on [TJ Null's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/htmlview#) OSCP prep list. Let's begin

# Reconnaissance

## Nmap  

Let's start of with an thorough nmap scan covering all TCP ports:

`nmap -p- -sV -sC -Pn -T4 -o full_thorough.log sunday.htb`

```

We find lot's of interesting stuff to investigate. Let's start of by looking at port `79` running `finger`!

## Finger

Finger is an application-level protocol that can be interfaced with the linux `finger` command to return information about the users currently logged into a specified remote host.

[![1](/assets/images/Sunday/1.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/1.png){: .full}

We can use [pentestmonkey's](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/finger-user-enum) `finger-user-enum`, to enumerate users on this machine.

`perl finger-user-enum.pl -U /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt -t 10.10.10.76`

[![2](/assets/images/Sunday/2.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/2.png){: .full}

From this we can see we have two users: `sunny` & `sammy`, with SSH access. We did see an open port `22022` running `OpenSSH` from our Nmap scans. Let's try attack this.

# Initial access

Let's some default credential pairs:

```
sunny:sunny
sunny:password
sunny:sunday
sammy:sammy
sammy:password
sammy:sunday
```

One of these pairs worked, I won't spoil it for you ;)

We can find the `user.txt` flag at `/home/sammy/user.txt`!

# Privilege Escalation

## sunny -> sammy

I always begin my Linux PE by checking for quick wins with `sudo -l` & `SUID` binaries. Let's check these out.

### sudo -l

[![4](/assets/images/Sunday/4.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/4.png){: .full}

There is a binary `/root/troll`, which we can execute, but unfortunately, is just a troll!

### SUID

[![5](/assets/images/Sunday/5.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/5.png){: .full}

I went through the list and checked binaries I was unsure about against the [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) list, but also didn't find anything.

My next call was to investigate the file system.

### File system enumeration

After having a brief look around I discovered the `/backup` directory which contains a very interesting file!

[![6](/assets/images/Sunday/6.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/6.png){: .full}

Great find! We have found a `backup.shadow` file containing sha256crypt hashes for the `sammy`  user.

#### Hash cracking

Copying the `sammy:$5$Ebkn8jlK$i6SSPa0.u7Gd.0oJOT4T421N2OvsfXqAT1vCoYUOigB:6445::::::` into a `sammy_hash` file we can crack it with `rockyou.txt`.

[![7](/assets/images/Sunday/7.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/7.png){: .full}

## sammy -> root

Using the command `su sammy` and using our newly found password we can escalate to sammy. Let's start with my usual checks for `sudo -l` & `SUID`

### sudo -l

[![8](/assets/images/Sunday/8.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/8.png){: .full}

Nice! Let's check out the [GTFObins entry](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/wget/) for wget to see if we can PE to root with this. 

[![9](/assets/images/Sunday/9.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/9.png){: .full}

Let's recreate this.

[![10](/assets/images/Sunday/10.png)](/assets/images/Sunday/10.png){: .full}

It worked, we succesfully got root and recovered the final flag. Hope you enjoyed this writeup!
