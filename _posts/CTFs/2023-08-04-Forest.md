This is a 'easy' rated HTB AD challenge were will be purely enumerating and attacking purely the DC. My offensive AD knowledge isn't great so I apologise for any poor explanations.

# Reconnaissance

## Nmap

I always start my boxes & pentests with a thorough nmap scan. This will help me enumerate the possible routes for enumeration & initial-access. 

`nmap -p- -sV -sC -o full_thorough.log 10.10.10.161`

Wow, there are a lot of ports open. I'm not going to explain each one, however, let's quickly list the stood out to me.

[![1](/assets/images/Forest/1.png)](/assets/images/Forest/1.png){: .full}


* `88/tcp` - Kerberos. Kerberos is an authentication protocol found in Windows AD enviroments. Seeing this port open is a indicator that this could be a Domain Controller. 

* `389/tcp` - LDAP. Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP, is a protocol that applications can use to speak to directory services, i.e. AD. This could be a possible route for enumeration which we will investigate later

* `445/tcp` - SMB. This is also a route for enumeration, we will look into this soon.

* `5985/tcp` - WinRM. This protocol allows remote access (i.e. a shell), but requires a valid set of credentials. This could be an oppurtinity for initial access.

In the `smb-os-discovery` scans we discover that the domain name is `htb.local`. I'll edit my hosts file to point this domain to `10.10.10.161`.

## SMB

We've discovered SMB is open, a common misconfiguration in AD enviroments is allowing guest or null authentication. Let's test this out.

[![2](/assets/images/Forest/2.png)](/assets/images/Forest/2.png){: .full}

In the above I'm using two sets of common null/guest credentials, `'':''` & `'guest':''`. We can see the later gets an authentication error, however the the first set, with an empty username & password, doesn't recieve any error.

Knowing this, let's try use `crackmapexec` to enumerate further information over SMB.

[![3](/assets/images/Forest/3.png)](/assets/images/Forest/3.png){: .full}

No luck. Although null authentication is allowed, it looks like we cannot enumerate any useful information through it.

## LDAP

LDAP is also a great place to look for enumeration, and also can be misconfigured to allow [anonymous authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled). Let's test this out.

`ldapsearch -x -H ldap://htb.local -D '' -w '' -b "DC=htb,DC=local"`


[![4](/assets/images/Forest/4.png)](/assets/images/Forest/4.png){: .full}

Fantastic. The output of this command dropped all the domain information from LDAP. This is a lot of information - we can use LDAP queries & filters to get a more manageable output.

### Extract users

`ldapsearch -x -H ldap://htb.local -D '' -w '' -b "DC=htb,DC=local" "objectClass=user" "sAMAccountName"`

This works by quering the whole directory, `DC=htb,DC=local`, where the `objectClass` attribute is set to `user`, and using `sAMAccountName` to extract to just the usernames. Let's see the output.

[![5](/assets/images/Forest/5.png)](/assets/images/Forest/5.png){: .full}

Great! We've got a list of users, but this is quite messy, let's do some Linux trickery to get an output of pure usernames.

[![6](/assets/images/Forest/6.png)](/assets/images/Forest/6.png){: .full}

Only the last 8 are real valid user accounts.

### Extract OUs

`ldapsearch -x -H ldap://htb.local -D '' -w '' -b "DC=htb,DC=local" "objectClass=organizationalUnit" "dn" | grep "dn:" | cut -d ':' -f2`

[![7](/assets/images/Forest/7.png)](/assets/images/Forest/7.png){: .full}

I then searched through these OUs individually with `ldapsearch`. All of the user accounts we previously discovered existed in the role-based OUs (Helpdesk, Sysadmin, Sales ect).

However, in the `Service Accounts` OU, I discovered a new service account!

[![8](/assets/images/Forest/8.png)](/assets/images/Forest/8.png){: .full}

We can add this `svc-alfresco` service account to our user list.

# Initial Access

When it comes to gaining initial access in AD enviroments, when we don't have an internal webservice to pwn to gain remote code execution there are a few options I know to take. 

1. Brute-forcing / Password spraying - We can enumerate the password policy to validate whether brute-forcing with a wordlist will be possible. If it's not, we can do a password spray attack.

2. AS-REP Roasting - This is a Kerberos attack on user accounts which have the specfic AD attribute, 'Dont require Kerberos preauthentication', enabled. With this technqiue it is possible to gain credentials to get initial access.

3. Service / Kernel exploits - Perhaps this version of Windows Server, or one of the running services, is inherently vulnerable to publically accessible exploits.

## AS-REP Roasting

Of these 3 options, I first went for the 2nd, AS-REP Roasting. This is because it's simple to check. Let's explain how this attack works.

[![9](/assets/images/Forest/9.png)](/assets/images/Forest/9.png){: .full}

The above shows the various stages of the Kerberos authentication protocol. At the first stage, a `AS_REQ` packet is sent. `AS_REQ` is sent the KDC on the Domain Controller, to request for a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT). The `AS_REQ` contains fields which include:

* A timestamp encrypted with the requesting users password hash

* The username of the authenticated user

Once the KDC recieves the `AS_REQ`, it will validate the request by decrypting the encrypted timestamp. It can do this because the Domain Controller will have a database of all the users hashes. Once validated, the Domain Controller will send back the `AS-REP` packet, which contains the TGT. Part of the TGT is signed with the user's password hash. This means if we have the TGT, we will be able to recover that users password hash, that can be cracked locally.

However, if the user has the attribute 'Don't require Kerberos pre-authentication' set, when we send a `AS_REQ` packet, the KDC **will not** validify the password. Instead, it will automatically just send back the TGT, giving us the hash to crack locally!

We can do this attack from our Linux box, aslong as we have network access to DC. I used the Impacket tool `GetNPUsers.py`

[![10](/assets/images/Forest/10.png)](/assets/images/Forest/10.png){: .full}

Fantastic! The `svc-alfresco` service account, did indeed have this 'Dont require Kerberos preauthentication' attribute set, so we could recover the hash.

### Hash cracking

Let's move this hash into text file `as_rep_hash` and crack in john with the `rockyou.txt` wordlist.

`john as_rep_hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
